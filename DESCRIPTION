Version: 0.1.0
Author: Cory Merow

Description: This package contains a collection of tools for thresholding range maps. The goal is to avoid the often arbitrary designation of binary range maps be choosing upper and lower bounds on viable thresholds, beyond which higher/lower threshold do not contain useful information for species' range modeling applications.
